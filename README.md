 Expectation-Maximization
 
1. Implementation of  a random number generator for a random vector 𝑋 􏰆 􏰀𝑋􏰅, 𝑋􏰓, 𝑋􏰔􏰂􏰫 having multivariate Gaussian
distribution with given matrix.

2. Implemented a 2‐dimensional random number generator for a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) pdf with 2 sub‐ populations.

3. A geyser is a hot spring characterized by an intermittent discharge of water and steam. Old Faithful is a famous cone geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. It has a predictable geothermal discharge and since 2000 it has erupted every 44 to 125 minutes. Refer to the addendum data file that contains waiting times and the durations for 272 eruptions.
      
      a. Generated a 2‐D scatter plot of the data. 
          and 𝑘‐means clustering routine on the data for 𝑘 
      
      b. Used a GMM‐EM algorithm to fit the dataset to a GMM pdf.
